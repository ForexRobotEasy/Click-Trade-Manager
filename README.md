# Click Trade Manager

This code is a sample implementation of the Click Trade Manager, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It provides functionality to monitor drawdown limits, track trade progress, and manage trade execution, stop losses, and take profits.

## Functionality

### Define drawdown limit

The `drawdownLimit` variable is used to set the maximum allowable drawdown limit as a percentage. For example, if `drawdownLimit` is set to 0.1, it means a 10% drawdown limit.

### Define profit target

The `profitTarget` variable is used to set the desired profit target as a percentage. For example, if `profitTarget` is set to 0.05, it means a 5% profit target.

### Monitor drawdown limits

The `monitorDrawdown()` function calculates the drawdown based on the account balance and equity. If the drawdown exceeds the defined limit, all open trades are closed and an alert is sent to the trader.

### Track trade progress and set profit targets

The `trackTradeProgress()` function calculates the profit percentage of the current trade. If the profit percentage exceeds the defined target, the trade is closed and an alert is sent to the trader.

### Handle trade execution, stop losses, and take profits

The `tradeManagement()` function iterates through all open orders and sets the stop loss and take profit levels based on the defined variables.

### Main program

The `OnTick()` function is the entry point of the program. It calls the `monitorDrawdown()`, `trackTradeProgress()`, and `tradeManagement()` functions to monitor and manage trades.

### Test the code

The `OnStart()` function is used to test the functionality of the code. It opens a test trade, waits for some time to simulate trade progress, and then closes the trade. The initial and final account balances are printed for reference.
